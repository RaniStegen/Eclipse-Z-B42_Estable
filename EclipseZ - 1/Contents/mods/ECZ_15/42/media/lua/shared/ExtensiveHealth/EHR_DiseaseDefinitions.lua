    Extensive Health Rework B42
    Disease Definitions - Phase 1 Environmental Diseases

    This file extends EHR.Disease.Diseases with new disease definitions.

    New diseases:
    - Common Cold: Cold weather + wet exposure, can progress to pneumonia
    - Pneumonia: From untreated cold, LETHAL without antibiotics
    - Dysentery: Contaminated water, LETHAL through dehydration
    - Hypothermia: Cold + wet exposure, LETHAL cardiac arrest

    v1.0.0 - Initial implementation
