--[[
    Extensive Health Rework B42
    Disease Module - Phase 1

    Adds realistic disease system with:
    - Food Poisoning (Phase 1)
    - Multi-day progression with incubation
    - Player dialogue hints
    - Integration with Blood Panel UI

    v1.0.1 - Cleanup: removed API discovery debug code (~325 lines)

    B42 API Notes (preserved from discovery):
    - CharacterStat.FOOD_SICKNESS: Component stat for food sickness (0-1 scale)
    - CharacterStat.SICKNESS: Aggregate stat that drives moodles (thresholds: 25%/50%/75%/90%)
    - CharacterStat.POISON: Raw food can spike this, but true PoisonPower food must remain dangerous
    - Moodles are READ-ONLY from Lua (no setMoodleLevel), driven by underlying stats
    - Old B41 methods like getFoodSicknessLevel()/setFoodSicknessLevel() DO NOT EXIST in B42
